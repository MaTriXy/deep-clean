# deep-clean
A Kotlin script that nukes all build caches from Gradle/Android projects.
Useful when Gradle or the IDE let you down üíî

![deep-clean in action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/153802/41173653-ab0ae36c-6b4f-11e8-8f98-8dba4340add7.png)

üé© h/t to [@Takhion](https://github.com/Takhion) for the original idea, and to
[@holgerbrandl](https://github.com/holgerbrandl) for KScript.

The script has been tested on macOS üçé, but it is completely untested on
Linux üêß and Windows üñ•Ô∏è.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK IN ANY CASE!**

## Running the script

`deep-clean` requires three components to be on your `PATH`:
 * [`kotlinc`](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html)
 * [`kscript`](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript)
 * [`mvn`](https://maven.apache.org/)

If you **have all three commands** on your `PATH`, then you can simply download
and execute the script:

```bash
$ [kscript] deep-clean.kts [options]
```

>Note: on macOS and Linux the script does not need `kscript` to be invoked, because
>it has a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)). On Windows, you
>will need to explicitly specify you want to use `kscript` to run it.

Where the options are:

```
-d --dry-run     Don't delete anything. Useful for testing. Implies --verbose.
-b --backup      Renames files and folders instead of deleting them. Implies
                 --verbose.
-i --ide         This also deletes IDEA/Android Studio project files (*.iml).
                 If used in conjunction with --nuke it will also delete the
                 .idea folder in the current directory.
-n --nuke        ‚ö†Ô∏è  THIS IS DANGEROUS SHIT ‚ö†Ô∏è  Super-deep clean
                 This includes clearing out global folders, including:
                  * the global Gradle cache
                  * the wrapper-downloaded Gradle distros
                  * the Gradle daemon data (logs, locks, etc.)
                  * the Android build cache
                 Nukes the entire thing from orbit ‚Äî it's the only way to be sure.
--not-recursive  Don't recursively search sub-folders of this folder for matches.
                 The default behaviour is to look for matches in sub-directories,
                 since things like 'build' folders and '.iml' files are not all
                 found at the top level of a project directory structure. This
                 flag is useful if you know you have matches you want to keep,
                 e.g., if your code contains a package with a name like 'build'.
                 This option severely limits the effectiveness of the deep clean.
-v --verbose     Print detailed information about all commands.
```

If you **DON'T have all three commands** on your `PATH`, then read on to the next
section to install them.

## Installing the script dependencies

To make the script run, we'll first need to install all the required dependencies.
All dependencies are available on [SDKMan!](https://sdkman.io/) (Windows, Linux, macOS)
and on [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (macOS only).

**Windows, Linux:**

```bash
$ sdk install kotlin
$ sdk install maven
$ sdk install kscript
```

**macOS:**

```bash
$ brew install kotlin maven holgerbrandl/tap/kscript
```
